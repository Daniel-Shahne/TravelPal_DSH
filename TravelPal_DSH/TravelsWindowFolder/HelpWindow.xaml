            Welcome to TravelPal! <LineBreak/>
            The buttons should be painfully obvious how to use but if not I'll help you out. <LineBreak/>
            "User" lets you see and change your account details. "Details" lets you see, well,<LineBreak/>
            the details of a travel you've highlighted in the list to the left. "Remove" will<LineBreak/>
            remove a booked travel and we'll pretend it never happened, including the <LineBreak/>
            payment (which is exactly $0 for all travels). But in case you actually want to go<LineBreak/>
            somewhere you can press "Add Travel" to book one. The "Help" button is how<LineBreak/>
            you ended up on this somewhat sarcastically written "help" page (i dont know if<LineBreak/>
            that had to be explained but i didn't want to end up having to komplementera<LineBreak/>
            the uppgift). "Sign out" incase anyone else wants to do this all over again.<LineBreak/>

            About TravelPal <LineBreak/>
            You know how your parents allways need help with doing something online<LineBreak/>
            because there are a ton of options (and they usually end up pressing some ad?). <LineBreak/>
            Well TravelPal is here to save the day by providing an idiot proof UI that noone<LineBreak/>
            would need a help section for to use! With buttons so comically large even your<LineBreak/>
            grandmother with her telescope glasses wont have to zoom in 175% for to see,<LineBreak/>
            gone are the days of picking up her laptop only to see like five sentences filling<LineBreak/>
            up the screen. Now you can almost trust her to not catch a virus while trying<LineBreak/>
            to book a trip and then blame you because you held her laptop for 6 minutes!
